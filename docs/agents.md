# Documentation: Agent Library

This file explains how to manage agents and discusses the strategies of some
agents available in the agent library. This file focuses on managing agents, 
including how to create an agent, using an agent in a game, and how standard 
agents function. (Standard agents are the hand-crafted agents that don't
require trained RL networks). 

## Features of an Agent
Every dominoe agent is a subclass of the `dominoeAgent` class found in the 
[`dominoesAgents.py`](../dominoesAgents.py) file.
